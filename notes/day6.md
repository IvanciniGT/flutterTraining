# HIVE

Hive is a nice library that allows to store information locally in the device's storage.
It is actually a DATABASE, a key-value database... such as MongoDB or Redis.

Tomorrow Last day:

- We will configure a test rest api backend to store our todos.
- We will create that with node and json-server.

- We will make use of this library called "http" to make requests to that backend.
  - To synchronize our todos with the backend.

- We will create an amazing splash screen.
  - In order to do that we will need to learn how to add native code to our flutter app.
    - We will do that both for:
      - Android
      - iOS

Or at least we will try to do all of that.
Case we don't have time I will anyway give you the code for all of that.

Just a remainder: Tomorrow class is from 19:00 to 21:00.
And tomorrow we will do a final test. It will be about 20:40.
